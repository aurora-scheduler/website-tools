Being an Apache project has been a wonderful experience. We've all learned a tremendous amount about how Open Source software works and how it should be run. The developers are inifinitely grateful for
the foundations support throught the years.

Unfortunately, the time has come to say goodbye to the ASF as our project embarks on a new journey.

As of today, we are rebooring the project under a new name and outside of the Apache Software Foundation.

The project will now use the name Aurora Scheduler and our new home will be over at [github](https://github.com/aurora-scheduler)

Our new website will be https://aurora-scheduler.github.io/blog/

We hope to make the transition as seamless as possible and we hope everyone will join us on this new journey we're embarking on.

Note: You may still find references to older releases under our former name, Apache Aurora, as well as references to Apache and the Apache Software foundation as we transition to our new home. Please note that Apache, Apache Aurora, and the Apache feather logo are trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation. References to Apache will be removed wherever deemed inappropriate.


## Thanks

We want to sincerely thank the ASF for the years of support. It has meant the world to this project and all the developers behind it.
