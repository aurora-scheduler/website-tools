Overview
--------

This document gives an overview of how Aurora works under the hood.
It assumes you've already worked through the "hello world" example
job in the [Aurora Tutorial](/documentation/0.10.0/tutorial/). Specifics of how to use Aurora are **not**
 given here, but pointers to documentation about how to use Aurora are
provided.

Aurora is a Mesos framework used to schedule *jobs* onto Mesos. Mesos
cares about individual *tasks*, but typical jobs consist of dozens or
hundreds of task replicas. Aurora provides a layer on top of Mesos with
its `Job` abstraction. An Aurora `Job` consists of a task template and
instructions for creating near-identical replicas of that task (modulo
things like "instance id" or specific port numbers which may differ from
machine to machine).

How many tasks make up a Job is complicated. On a basic level, a Job consists of
one task template and instructions for creating near-idential replicas of that task
(otherwise referred to as "instances" or "shards").

However, since Jobs can be updated on the fly, a single Job identifier or *job key*
can have multiple job configurations associated with it.

For example, consider when I have a Job with 4 instances that each
request 1 core of cpu, 1 GB of RAM, and 1 GB of disk space as specified
in the configuration file `hello_world.aurora`. I want to
update it so it requests 2 GB of RAM instead of 1. I create a new
configuration file to do that called `new_hello_world.aurora` and
issue a `aurora job update <job_key_value>/0-1 new_hello_world.aurora`
command.

This results in instances 0 and 1 having 1 cpu, 2 GB of RAM, and 1 GB of disk space,
while instances 2 and 3 have 1 cpu, 1 GB of RAM, and 1 GB of disk space. If instance 3
dies and restarts, it restarts with 1 cpu, 1 GB RAM, and 1 GB disk space.

So that means there are two simultaneous task configurations for the same Job
at the same time, just valid for different ranges of instances.

This isn't a recommended pattern, but it is valid and supported by the
Aurora scheduler. This most often manifests in the "canary pattern" where
instance 0 runs with a different configuration than instances 1-N to test
different code versions alongside the actual production job.

A task can merely be a single *process* corresponding to a single
command line, such as `python2.6 my_script.py`. However, a task can also
consist of many separate processes, which all run within a single
sandbox. For example, running multiple cooperating agents together,
such as `logrotate`, `installer`, master, or slave processes. This is
where Thermos  comes in. While Aurora provides a `Job` abstraction on
top of Mesos `Tasks`, Thermos provides a `Process` abstraction
underneath Mesos `Task`s and serves as part of the Aurora framework's
executor.

You define `Job`s,` Task`s, and `Process`es in a configuration file.
Configuration files are written in Python, and make use of the Pystachio
templating language. They end in a `.aurora` extension.

Pystachio is a type-checked dictionary templating library.

Each `Task` has a *sandbox* created when the `Task` starts and garbage
collected when it finishes. All of a `Task'`s processes run in its
sandbox, so processes can share state by using a shared current working
directory.

The sandbox garbage collection policy considers many factors, most
importantly age and size. It makes a best-effort attempt to keep
sandboxes around as long as possible post-task in order for service
owners to inspect data and logs, should the `Task` have completed
abnormally. But you can't design your applications assuming sandboxes
will be around forever, e.g. by building log saving or other
checkpointing mechanisms directly into your application or into your
`Job` description.

Job Lifecycle
-------------

When Aurora reads a configuration file and finds a `Job` definition, it:

1.  Evaluates the `Job` definition.
2.  Splits the `Job` into its constituent `Task`s.
3.  Sends those `Task`s to the scheduler.
4.  The scheduler puts the `Task`s into `PENDING` state, starting each
    `Task`'s life cycle.

### Life Of A Task

![Life of a task](images/lifeofatask.png)

### PENDING to RUNNING states

When a `Task` is in the `PENDING` state, the scheduler constantly
searches for machines satisfying that `Task`'s resource request
requirements (RAM, disk space, CPU time) while maintaining configuration
constraints such as "a `Task` must run on machines  dedicated  to a
particular role" or attribute limit constraints such as "at most 2
`Task`s from the same `Job` may run on each rack". When the scheduler
finds a suitable match, it assigns the `Task` to a machine and puts the
`Task` into the `ASSIGNED` state.

From the `ASSIGNED` state, the scheduler sends an RPC to the slave
machine containing `Task` configuration, which the slave uses to spawn
an executor responsible for the `Task`'s lifecycle. When the scheduler
receives an acknowledgement that the machine has accepted the `Task`,
the `Task` goes into `STARTING` state.

`STARTING` state initializes a `Task` sandbox. When the sandbox is fully
initialized, Thermos begins to invoke `Process`es. Also, the slave
machine sends an update to the scheduler that the `Task` is
in `RUNNING` state.

If a `Task` stays in `ASSIGNED` or `STARTING` for too long, the
scheduler forces it into `LOST` state, creating a new `Task` in its
place that's sent into `PENDING` state. This is technically true of any
active state: if the Mesos core tells the scheduler that a slave has
become unhealthy (or outright disappeared), the `Task`s assigned to that
slave go into `LOST` state and new `Task`s are created in their place.
From `PENDING` state, there is no guarantee a `Task` will be reassigned
to the same machine unless job constraints explicitly force it there.

If there is a state mismatch, (e.g. a machine returns from a `netsplit`
and the scheduler has marked all its `Task`s `LOST` and rescheduled
them), a state reconciliation process kills the errant `RUNNING` tasks,
which may take up to an hour. But to emphasize this point: there is no
uniqueness guarantee for a single instance of a job in the presence of
network partitions. If the Task requires that, it should be baked in at
the application level using a distributed coordination service such as
Zookeeper.

### Task Updates

`Job` configurations can be updated at any point in their lifecycle.
Usually updates are done incrementally using a process called a *rolling
upgrade*, in which Tasks are upgraded in small groups, one group at a
time.  Updates are done using various Aurora Client commands.

For a configuration update, the Aurora Client calculates required changes
by examining the current job config state and the new desired job config.
It then starts a rolling batched update process by going through every batch
and performing these operations:

- If an instance is present in the scheduler but isn't in the new config,
  then that instance is killed.
- If an instance is not present in the scheduler but is present in
  the new config, then the instance is created.
- If an instance is present in both the scheduler the new config, then
  the client diffs both task configs. If it detects any changes, it
  performs an instance update by killing the old config instance and adds
  the new config instance.

The Aurora client continues through the instance list until all tasks are
updated, in `RUNNING,` and healthy for a configurable amount of time.
If the client determines the update is not going well (a percentage of health
checks have failed), it cancels the update.

Update cancellation runs a procedure similar to the described above
update sequence, but in reverse order. New instance configs are swapped
with old instance configs and batch updates proceed backwards
from the point where the update failed. E.g.; (0,1,2) (3,4,5) (6,7,
8-FAIL) results in a rollback in order (8,7,6) (5,4,3) (2,1,0).

### HTTP Health Checking and Graceful Shutdown

The Executor implements a protocol for rudimentary control of a task via HTTP.  Tasks subscribe for
this protocol by declaring a port named `health`.  Take for example this configuration snippet:

    nginx = Process(
      name = 'nginx',
      cmdline = './run_nginx.sh -port {{thermos.ports[http]}}')

When this Process is included in a job, the job will be allocated a port, and the command line
will be replaced with something like:

    ./run_nginx.sh -port 42816

Where 42816 happens to be the allocated. port.  Typically, the Executor monitors Processes within
a task only by liveness of the forked process.  However, when a `health` port was allocated, it will
also send periodic HTTP health checks.  A task requesting a `health` port must handle the following
requests:

| HTTP request            | Description                             |
| ------------            | -----------                             |
| `GET /health`           | Inquires whether the task is healthy.   |
| `POST /quitquitquit`    | Task should initiate graceful shutdown. |
| `POST /abortabortabort` | Final warning task is being killed.     |

Please see the
[configuration reference](/documentation/0.10.0/configuration-reference/#healthcheckconfig-objects) for
configuration options for this feature.

#### Snoozing Health Checks

If you need to pause your health check, you can do so by touching a file inside of your sandbox,
named `.healthchecksnooze`

As long as that file is present, health checks will be disabled, enabling users to gather core dumps
or other performance measurements without worrying about Aurora's health check killing their
process.

WARNING: Remember to remove this when you are done, otherwise your instance will have permanently
disabled health checks.

#### Tearing a task down

The Executor follows an escalation sequence when killing a running task:

  1. If `health` port is not present, skip to (5)
  2. POST /quitquitquit
  3. wait 5 seconds
  4. POST /abortabortabort
  5. Send SIGTERM (`kill`)
  6. Send SIGKILL (`kill -9`)

If the Executor notices that all Processes in a Task have aborted during this sequence, it will
not proceed with subsequent steps.  Note that graceful shutdown is best-effort, and due to the many
inevitable realities of distributed systems, it may not be performed.

### Giving Priority to Production Tasks: PREEMPTING

Sometimes a Task needs to be interrupted, such as when a non-production
Task's resources are needed by a higher priority production Task. This
type of interruption is called a *pre-emption*. When this happens in
Aurora, the non-production Task is killed and moved into
the `PREEMPTING` state  when both the following are true:

- The task being killed is a non-production task.
- The other task is a `PENDING` production task that hasn't been
  scheduled due to a lack of resources.

Since production tasks are much more important, Aurora kills off the
non-production task to free up resources for the production task. The
scheduler UI shows the non-production task was preempted in favor of the
production task. At some point, tasks in `PREEMPTING` move to `KILLED`.

Note that non-production tasks consuming many resources are likely to be
preempted in favor of production tasks.

### Natural Termination: FINISHED, FAILED

A `RUNNING` `Task` can terminate without direct user interaction. For
example, it may be a finite computation that finishes, even something as
simple as `echo hello world. `Or it could be an exceptional condition in
a long-lived service. If the `Task` is successful (its underlying
processes have succeeded with exit status `0` or finished without
reaching failure limits) it moves into `FINISHED` state. If it finished
after reaching a set of failure limits, it goes into `FAILED` state.

### Forceful Termination: KILLING, RESTARTING

You can terminate a `Task` by issuing an `aurora job kill` command, which
moves it into `KILLING` state. The scheduler then sends the slave  a
request to terminate the `Task`. If the scheduler receives a successful
response, it moves the Task into `KILLED` state and never restarts it.

The scheduler has access to a non-public `RESTARTING` state. If a `Task`
is forced into the `RESTARTING` state, the scheduler kills the
underlying task but in parallel schedules an identical replacement for
it.

Configuration
-------------

You define and configure your Jobs (and their Tasks and Processes) in
Aurora configuration files. Their filenames end with the `.aurora`
suffix, and you write them in Python making use of the Pystachio
templating language, along
with specific Aurora, Mesos, and Thermos commands and methods. See the
[Configuration Guide and Reference](/documentation/0.10.0/configuration-reference/) and
[Configuration Tutorial](/documentation/0.10.0/configuration-tutorial/).

Service Discovery
-----------------

It is possible for the Aurora executor to announce tasks into ServerSets for
the purpose of service discovery.  ServerSets use the Zookeeper [group membership pattern](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/recipes.html#sc_outOfTheBox)
of which there are several reference implementations:

  - [C++](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/src/zookeeper/group.cpp)
  - [Java](https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/src/java/com/twitter/common/zookeeper/ServerSetImpl.java#L221)
  - [Python](https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/src/python/twitter/common/zookeeper/serverset/serverset.py#L51)

These can also be used natively in Finagle using the [ZookeeperServerSetCluster](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/blob/master/finagle-serversets/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/zookeeper/ZookeeperServerSetCluster.scala).

For more information about how to configure announcing, see the [Configuration Reference](/documentation/0.10.0/configuration-reference/).

Creating Jobs
-------------

You create and manipulate Aurora Jobs with the Aurora client, which starts all its
command line commands with
`aurora`. See [Aurora Client Commands](/documentation/0.10.0/client-commands/) for details
about the Aurora Client.

Interacting With Jobs
---------------------

You interact with Aurora jobs either via:

- Read-only Web UIs

  Part of the output from creating a new Job is a URL for the Job's scheduler UI page.

  For example:

      vagrant@precise64:~$ aurora job create devcluster/www-data/prod/hello \
      /vagrant/examples/jobs/hello_world.aurora
      INFO] Creating job hello
      INFO] Response from scheduler: OK (message: 1 new tasks pending for job www-data/prod/hello)
      INFO] Job url: http://precise64:8081/scheduler/www-data/prod/hello

  The "Job url" goes to the Job's scheduler UI page. To go to the overall scheduler UI page,
  stop at the "scheduler" part of the URL, in this case, `http://precise64:8081/scheduler`

  You can also reach the scheduler UI page via the Client command `aurora job open`:

      aurora job open [<cluster>[/<role>[/<env>/<job_name>]]]

  If only the cluster is specified, it goes directly to that cluster's scheduler main page.
  If the role is specified, it goes to the top-level role page. If the full job key is specified,
  it goes directly to the job page where you can inspect individual tasks.

  Once you click through to a role page, you see Jobs arranged separately by pending jobs, active
  jobs, and finished jobs. Jobs are arranged by role, typically a service account for production
  jobs and user accounts for test or development jobs.
