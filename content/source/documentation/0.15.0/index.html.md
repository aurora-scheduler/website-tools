## Introduction

Apache Aurora is a service scheduler that runs on top of Apache Mesos, enabling you to run
long-running services, cron jobs, and ad-hoc jobs that take advantage of Apache Mesos' scalability,
fault-tolerance, and resource isolation.

We encourage you to ask questions on the [Aurora user list](http://aurora.apache.org/community/) or
the `#aurora` IRC channel on `irc.freenode.net`.
