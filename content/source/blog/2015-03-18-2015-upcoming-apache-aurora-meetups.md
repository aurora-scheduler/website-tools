Meetups are opportunities to bring together members of an open source community to learn about the project, share best practices, and meet one another; naturally we're excited to see a growing number of events featuring Apache Aurora, and we hope you'll join us at a meetup near you!

There are two upcoming Apache Aurora meetups on our radar:

 * New York City, March 25th, 2015 - [NYC MUG, Apache Aurora meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Apache-Mesos-NYC-Meetup/events/220801840/)
 * Bay Area, April 30th, 2015 - [Bay Area Apache Aurora Users meetup, From Monolith to Microservices w/ Aurora](http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Apache-Aurora-Users-Group/events/221219480/)

## Apache Aurora Users Groups

Live in San Francisco or the surrounding Bay Area? Join the recently-established [Bay Area Apache Aurora Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Apache-Aurora-Users-Group/), which will be home to future Apache Aurora meetups, in addition to the existing [Apache Mesos User Group](www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Mesos-User-Group/).

If you're interested in establishing an Apache Aurora Users Group in a city near you or youâ€™re hosting an Apache Aurora talk, please let us know on the project mailing list (dev@aurora.apache.org) or IRC (#aurora on freenode.net) and we'll help you promote your events.

## Recent Meetup Videos

On February 19th, the Bay Area Apache Mesos User Group hosted a meetup on Apache Aurora, and videos from the two talks are now online. Check them out:
